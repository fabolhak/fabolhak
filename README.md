# Hi there 👋,
I'm Fabian. I used to do a lot of public robotics software programming during my time at [TUM Phoenix Robotics](https://github.com/tum-phoenix) 🏎️. Nowadays I work for Bosch Rexroth on mobile robots (mostly architecture stuff). So on my GitHub you will probably just find some minor toy projects in recent times.
